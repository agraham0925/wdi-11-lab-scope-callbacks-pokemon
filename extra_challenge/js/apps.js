console.log('test test')

// 1. Iterate over each item in the array
for(let i = 0; i < tagMap.length; i++){
			console.log(tagMap[i]);	
}	


// 2. Filter out all objects where the Language property does not equal to en (stands for English)

// 3. Loop over the filtered array and...

// 4. Output each array item's key and value

// Hint: Remember, this is an array of objects. This means you'll need to use both array methods and 
// object concepts to complete this. Also remember that some methods return new copies of arrays instead 
// of changing their values in place
